/**
 * @file orb_atomic.h
 *
 * Provides atomic integers and counters. Each method is executed atomically and
 * thus can be used to prevent data races and add memory synchronization between
 * threads.
 *
 * In addition to the atomicity, each method serves as a memory barrier
 * (sequential consistent ordering). This means all operations that happen
 * before and could potentially have visible side-effects in other threads will
 * happen before the method is executed.
 *
 * The implementation uses the built-in methods from GCC (supported by Clang as
 * well).
 * @see https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/_005f_005fatomic-Builtins.html.
 *
 * @note: on ARM, the instructions LDREX and STREX might be emitted. To ensure
 * correct behavior, the exclusive monitor needs to be cleared on a task switch
 * (via CLREX). This happens automatically e.g. on ARMv7-M as part of an
 * exception entry or exit sequence.
